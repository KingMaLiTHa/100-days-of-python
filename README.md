# <p align="center">100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp</p>

<p align="center">Starting from: February 21, 2023</p>

<p align="center">I [pledge](App Brewery - 100 Days of Python Pledge.jpg) to complete this 100 days of coding challenge.</p>

<p>I'm on a mission to finish the Udemy course "100 Days of Coding - The Entire Python Pro Bootcamp for 2023." I chose to enroll in this course because I wanted to learn Python, and I hoped it would offer more structure and better instruction than "self-learning" did. I've been participating in this course, taking notes and doing other things, and doing my best to complete all of the assignments. This repository will be used by me as a means of accessing them as, if, and when I need them. 100 tasks over 100 days.</p>
